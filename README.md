# React Starter

##WIP

## The problem
Every time you use create-react-app, you have to add all the pieces to create the starting point for your environment, such as .editorconfig, adjusting .gitignore,
standard CSS resets and the like.

## This package
Without forking react-scripts, this starter kit provides the customized starting point I prefer for react app projects and ensures react-scripts are up to date 
after installing.
